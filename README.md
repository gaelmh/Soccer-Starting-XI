This project analyzes the "Football Data from TransferMarkt" dataset from Kaggle to predict whether a soccer player will be in the starting lineup for an upcoming game. By using AWS tools including EMR, S3, and Athena, it leverages techniques like class balancing, data staging and querying, and modeling to provide predictive insights.
